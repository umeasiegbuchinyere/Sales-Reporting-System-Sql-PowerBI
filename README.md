# Project Overview
The Sales Reporting System is a data-driven solution designed to help businesses track, analyze, and visualize their sales performance. The project leverages PostgreSQL for 
database management and Power BI for interactive reporting, providing stakeholders with actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

# Data Source
The dataset used in this project was synthetically generated to simulate real-world sales transactions.
It contains:

- Customer data – 5 unique customers with names, IDs, and locations.
- Product data – 7 products with categories, prices, and IDs.
- Order data – 35 orders including products purchased, customers, and quantities.

This data was manually created and inserted into a PostgreSQL database to demonstrate the complete workflow—from database creation and querying to interactive reporting in Power BI.

# Problem Statement
Businesses often store sales records but lack a streamlined way to analyze them for decision-making. Without clear visibility into customer purchasing patterns, top-selling products, 
and sales trends, opportunities for growth and optimization are missed. This project addresses the need for a centralized Sales Reporting System that organizes data in PostgreSQL and
delivers actionable insights through Power BI dashboards.

# Tools Used
- PostgreSQL – Database creation, management, and querying.
- pgAdmin – Interface for managing the PostgreSQL database.
- Power BI – Data visualization and interactive dashboard creation.
